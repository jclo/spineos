# SpineOS

SpineOS is a tiny, but fully scalable, Linux system running into a virtual machine with all the services required to get a PaaS running on top of public or private Iaas Cloud Platforms.

SpineOS has a limited footprint. It runs on PC laptops.

So, with SpineOS you can write and test your application on your PC laptop. And, when it is ready, you can move SpineOS with your running application on a private or public IaaS Cloud Platform without any changes.
